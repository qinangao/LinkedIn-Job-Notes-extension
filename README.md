# 📝 LinkedIn Job Notes Extension

A Chrome extension that helps you remember why you didn’t apply for certain jobs on LinkedIn, so you don’t waste time clicking on the same listings repeatedly.

## 💡 Why I Built This

When job searching on LinkedIn, I kept clicking on the same jobs I’d already viewed. These were roles that didn’t fit my criteria, but I couldn’t remember _why_ I hadn’t applied. Was it the experience? Location? Tech stack? I’d click the job, read through it again, and realise “oh right, this is on-site but I need remote or hybrid” or “this isn’t for juniors”.

This extension solves that problem by letting you add notes to jobs you’ve viewed. The next time you see that job in your search results, a 📝 badge appears next to the title. Hover over it to see your note instantly — no need to click through again!

## ✨ Features

- **Quick Notes**: Add notes to any LinkedIn job with a simple pop-up form
- **Visual Indicators**: A 📝 emoji badge appears next to jobs you’ve annotated
- **Hover to Remember**: Hover over the badge to see your note in a tooltip
- **Organised History**: View all your notes in one place with links back to the jobs
- **Auto-Sync**: Notes appear automatically as you browse — no manual refresh needed

## 🎯 Perfect For

- Job seekers applying for multiple positions each day
- Anyone who wants to track why certain jobs aren’t a good fit
- People who want to avoid re-reading the same job descriptions
- Keeping notes on salary ranges, tech requirements, or red flags

## 📸 How It Works

1. **Browse jobs** on LinkedIn as usual
2. When you find a job you’re not interested in, **click the extension icon**
3. **Type why you’re not applying** (e.g., “Salary too low – wants £50k”, “Requires 5 years’ Python experience”, “No remote option”)
4. **Click ‘Add Note’** — that’s it!
5. Next time you see that job, you’ll see a **📝 badge** next to the title
6. **Hover over the badge** to instantly see your note without clicking
